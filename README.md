# 📊 Grade & CGPA Calculator (Python • NumPy • Pandas)

This project is a *Grade and CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) Calculator* built using *Pandas* and *NumPy*.  
It reads student marks from an Excel/CSV file, calculates the *grade* for each subject, converts grades into *grade points, computes the **CGPA*, and finally exports the updated result back into a new Excel file.

## 🧮 CGPA Formula
 
CGPA = 𝛴(Grade Point x Course Credit)/Σ(Course Credit)


Example:  
If a student gets A in a 4-credit course,  
Grade Point = 9  
Weighted = 9 × 4 = 36
